                  Options trading involves the buying or selling of an
                  underlying asset at a pre-negotiated price by a specified
                  future date. Unlike stock trading, where you decide on the
                  number of shares and your broker executes the order at the
                  prevailing market price, options trading is more intricate. It
                  demands a grasp of advanced strategies, and the process of
                  opening an options trading account entails additional steps
                  compared to a typical investment account. <br /> <br />{" "}
                  Navigating the stock options landscape can be more complex
                  than trading stocks, requiring a nuanced understanding of
                  various strategies. In 2022, the stock market has experienced
                  fluctuations influenced by concerns about inflation, Russia's
                  invasion of Ukraine, and escalating oil prices. During
                  volatile market conditions, options trading tends to
                  intensify, as highlighted by Randy Frederick, Managing
                  Director of Trading and Derivatives at the Schwab Center for
                  Financial Research. <br /> <br /> While options can be
                  utilized for speculation and gambling, their primary purpose
                  is often seen as a means to protect against downside risks.
                  According to Randy Frederick, "Options are one way to generate
                  income when the markets arenâ€™t going up." <br /> <br /> The
                  Options Clearing Corporation reported a significant uptick in
                  options trading, with 939 million contracts traded in March
                  2022, marking a 4.5% increase compared to March 2021. This
                  surge made March 2022 the second-highest trading month on
                  record.
